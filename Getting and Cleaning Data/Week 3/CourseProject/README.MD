# COURSE PROJECT

The project is based on the data that are downloaded from:

In this project followings steps are taken to produce tidy dataset:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


# How to run
If you have cloned the project, I have also submitted the dataset so that anyone can run it.

- first, change the working directory to the cloned folder using setwd() 
- second, run/source the run_analysis.R
